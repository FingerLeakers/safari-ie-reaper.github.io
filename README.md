I've created this simple HTML page to test the CSS webkit filter DoS attack created by pwnsdx

The page would be this:

(but you can only see it with the right browser!)

The Exploit it works on Safari and IE (and i think Edge) on Windows, Safari (Mac iPhone, iPad etc.),</BR>
and some user he says it also works on Ubuntu, but I do not know what browser it is...</BR>
Don't works on Chrome, Opera and Mozilla (I wonder why it does not surprise me ....).</BR>
</BR>
In practice with this technique you can crash the browser, </BR>
regardless of whether it is on PC, smartphone, etc.</BR>
On iPhone and Mac (and Ubuntu maybe) restart also the the machine.
